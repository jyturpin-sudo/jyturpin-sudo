- 👋 Hi, I’m @jyturpin-sudo, I am new to all of this.I was working on Microsoft Edge preparing for the June end of Internet Explorer.  And I was taken to Github, what is this all about?
- 👀 I’m interested in not sure how to repy.  I'm not sure how to reply. What I'm interested in on Github? I have no clue what Github is yet so this will be something I'm interested in learning about Github. If it is more personal then my reply would be my parter and my granddaughter. They are the two most important people in my life.  We have our own business that keeps me so busy.  It is a good thing to have so much, boy I'm tired and ready to get some people hired to get some of my life back.  I need a day at the bathes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Github is the only thing, well when it comes to this tech stuff I'm always learning.  I am not really to good at this, I do it for our business. Most of the stuff I just do what I can to stay as caught up as I can.  It was all about getting our name out there.  We don't have to do much anay more,as far as advertizing. Our name locally is good and people love our service, we love what we do.  Most days we love what we do, there is those few days you want to scream and claw your face off."Get it Patsy".
...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, I have seen and used that word(thanks to Editor) more in two days than I ever have in 51 years.  I have nothing to look forward to work on, maybe I will on here.  It maybe a fun place to get something done.  One thing I would like to get help on is how to get Grindr to remove my account off a life time band.  Because I offered to pay someone way in the bathes in Louisville KY they thought I was hooking.  Nobody going to pay for this, I promise that.  No matter how good I look.
...
- 📫 How to reach me with email at this point I guess.  I will give the long address that I got here today. 99608666+jyturpin-sudo@users.noreply.github.com..
